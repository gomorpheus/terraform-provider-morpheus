  description = "terraform example global router quota policy"
  enabled     = true
  max_routers = 20
  scope       = "global"
}
```

Creating the policy with a cloud scope:

```terraform
resource "morpheus_router_quota_policy" "tf_example_router_quota_policy_cloud" {
  name        = "tf_example_router_quota_policy_cloud"
  description = "terraform example cloud router quota policy"
  enabled     = true
  max_routers = 20
  scope       = "cloud"
  cloud_id    = 1
}
```

Creating the policy with a group scope:

```terraform
resource "morpheus_router_quota_policy" "tf_example_router_quota_policy_group" {
  name        = "tf_example_router_quota_policy_group"
  description = "terraform example group router quota policy"
  enabled     = true
  max_routers = 20
  scope       = "group"
  group_id    = 1
}
```

```terraform
resource "morpheus_router_quota_policy" "tf_example_router_quota_policy_role" {
  name            = "tf_example_router_quota_policy_role"
  description     = "terraform example role router quota policy"
  enabled         = true
  max_routers     = 20
  scope           = "role"
  role_id         = 1
  apply_each_user = true
}
```
