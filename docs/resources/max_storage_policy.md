## Example Usage

Creating the policy with a global scope:

```terraform
resource "morpheus_max_storage_policy" "tf_example_max_storage_policy_global" {
  name        = "tf_example_max_storage_policy_global"
  description = "terraform example global max storage policy"
  enabled     = true
  max_storage = 100
  scope       = "global"
}
```

Creating the policy with a cloud scope:

```terraform
resource "morpheus_max_storage_policy" "tf_example_max_storage_policy_cloud" {
  name        = "tf_example_max_storage_policy_cloud"
  description = "terraform example cloud max storage policy"
  enabled     = true
  max_storage = 100
  scope       = "cloud"
  cloud_id    = 1
}
```

Creating the policy with a group scope:

```terraform
resource "morpheus_max_storage_policy" "tf_example_max_storage_policy_group" {
  name        = "tf_example_max_storage_policy_group"
  description = "terraform example group max storage policy"
  enabled     = true
  max_storage = 100
  scope       = "group"
  group_id    = 1
}
```

Creating the policy with a role scope:

```terraform
resource "morpheus_max_storage_policy" "tf_example_max_storage_policy_role" {
  name            = "tf_example_max_storage_policy_role"
  description     = "terraform example role max storage policy"
  enabled         = true
  max_storage     = 100
  scope           = "role"
  role_id         = 1
  apply_each_user = true
}
```

Creating the policy with a user scope:

```terraform
resource "morpheus_max_storage_policy" "tf_example_max_storage_policy_user" {
  name        = "tf_example_max_storage_policy_user"
  description = "terraform example user max storage policy"
  enabled     = true
  max_storage = 100
  scope       = "user"
  user_id     = 1
