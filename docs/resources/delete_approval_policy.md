## Example Usage

Creating the policy with a global scope:

```terraform
data "morpheus_integration" "servicenow_prod" {
  name = "SNOW Production"
}

data "morpheus_servicenow_workflow" "morpheus_example" {
  name           = "Knowledge - Retire Knowledge"
  integration_id = data.morpheus_integration.servicenow_prod.id
}

resource "morpheus_delete_approval_policy" "tf_example_delete_approval_policy_global" {
  name           = "tf_example_delete_approval_policy_global"
  description    = "terraform example global delete approval policy"
  enabled        = true
  integration_id = data.morpheus_integration.servicenow_prod.id
  workflow_id    = data.morpheus_servicenow_workflow.morpheus_example.id
  scope          = "global"
}
```

Creating the policy with a cloud scope:

```terraform
resource "morpheus_delete_approval_policy" "tf_example_delete_approval_policy_global" {
  name           = "tf_example_delete_approval_policy_global"
  description    = "terraform example global delete approval policy"
  enabled        = true
  integration_id = 1
  workflow_id    = 10
  scope          = "cloud"
  cloud_id       = 1
}
```

Creating the policy with a group scope:

```terraform
resource "morpheus_delete_approval_policy" "tf_example_delete_approval_policy_global" {
  name                   = "tf_example_delete_approval_policy_global"
  description            = "terraform example global delete approval policy"
  enabled                = true
  use_internal_approvals = true
  scope                  = "group"
  group_id               = 1
}
```

Creating the policy with a role scope:

```terraform
resource "morpheus_delete_approval_policy" "tf_example_delete_approval_policy_global" {
  name            = "tf_example_delete_approval_policy_global"
  description     = "terraform example global delete approval policy"
  enabled         = true
  integration_id  = 1
  workflow_id     = 10
  scope           = "role"
  role_id         = 1
  apply_each_user = true
}
```

Creating the policy with a user scope:

```terraform
resource "morpheus_delete_approval_policy" "tf_example_delete_approval_policy_global" {
  name                   = "tf_example_delete_approval_policy_global"
  description            = "terraform example global delete approval policy"
  enabled                = true
  use_internal_approvals = true
  scope                  = "user"
  user_id                = 1
}
```
