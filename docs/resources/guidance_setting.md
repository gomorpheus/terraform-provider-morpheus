# morpheus_guidance_setting

Provides a Morpheus guidance setting resource.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "morpheus_guidance_setting" "tf_example_guidance_setting" {
  power_settings_average_cpu          = 75
  power_settings_maximum_cpu          = 500
  power_settings_network_threshold    = 2000
  cpu_upsize_average_cpu              = 50
  cpu_upsize_maximum_cpu              = 99
  memory_upsize_minimum_free_memory   = 10
  memory_downsize_average_free_memory = 60
  memory_downsize_maximum_free_memory = 30
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `cpu_upsize_average_cpu` (Number) CPU up-size is recommended if the average CPU percentage exceeds this value
- `cpu_upsize_maximum_cpu` (Number) CPU up-size is recommended if the maximum CPU percentage exceeds this value
- `memory_downsize_average_free_memory` (Number) Memory down-size is recommended if the average free memory is above this value
- `memory_downsize_maximum_free_memory` (Number) Memory down-size is recommended if free memory has never dipped below this value
- `memory_upsize_minimum_free_memory` (Number) Memory up-size will be recommended if free memory dips below this value
- `power_settings_average_cpu` (Number) Shutdown will be recommended if the average CPU usage is below this value
- `power_settings_maximum_cpu` (Number) Shutdown will be recommended if the CPU usage never exceeds this value
- `power_settings_network_threshold` (Number) Shutdown will be recommended if the average network bandwidth is below this value

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of the guidance settings

## Import
