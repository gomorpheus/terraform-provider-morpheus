# Morpheus Provider

The Morpheus provider is used to interact with the resources supported by [Morpheus Cloud Management Platform (CMP)](https://morpheusdata.com/). The provider needs to be configured with the proper credentials before it can be used.

Use the navigation to the left to read about the available resources.

## Authentication

The Morpheus provider supports authentication via username/password or an access token. The [authentication guide](guides/auth.md) describes how to obtain client credentials.

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    morpheus = {
      source  = "morpheus/morpheus"
      version = "~> 0.1"
    }
  }
}

# Configure the provider
provider "morpheus" {
  url      = "${var.morpheus_url}"
  username = "${var.morpheus_username}"
  password = "${var.morpheus_password}"       
}
```
