# Morpheus Provider

Morpheus is a next-generation hybrid cloud management and application infrastructure automation engine.

The Morpheus provider is used to interact with the Morpheus Cloud Management Platform (CMP) appliance. The provider needs to be configured with the proper credentials before it can be used.

Use the navigation to the left to read about the available resources.

## Authenticating with Morpheus

The Morpheus provider supports authentication via username/password or an access token. The [authentication guide](guides/auth.md) describes how to obtain client credentials.

## Example Usage

```terraform
// Pin the version
terraform {
  required_providers {
    morpheus = {
      source  = "morpheus/morpheus"
      version = "~> 0.1"
    }
  }
}

// Configure the provider
provider "morpheus" {
  url      = "${var.morpheus_url}"
  username = "${var.morpheus_username}"
  password = "${var.morpheus_password}"       
}
```
