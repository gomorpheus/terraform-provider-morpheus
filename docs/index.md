# Morpheus Provider

The Morpheus provider is used to interact with the resources supported by [Morpheus Cloud Management Platform (CMP)](https://morpheusdata.com/). The provider needs to be configured with the proper credentials before it can be used.

Use the navigation to the left to read about the available resources.

    }
  }
